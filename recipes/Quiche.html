    <h4 class="about">You can really add anything you want to this easy quiche recipe — other vegetables, different cheeses or seasonings — but ham and cheese is our favorite way to do it up. I don’t know about you, but we love eggs for any meal of the day here. We’ll take any excuse to enjoy them for breakfast, lunch or dinner, and this easy quiche recipe definitely bridges the gap between all three. I love keeping my quiche recipes easy, and serving them up with lovely fruit or a beautiful fresh salad!</h4>
    <h4 class="para">Tips for Making This Easy Quiche Recipe:
        This recipe really couldn’t be any easier — start with a premade pie crust, and fill it with your favorite things, plus some eggs and milk.
        A lot of quiche recipes you will find have precooked ingredients and require an extra pan plus additional prep time. We are using cooked, cubed ham and green onions in this recipe to ensure this easy breakfast quiche recipe comes together as quickly as possible!
        Don’t forget to keep an eye on the quiche as it bakes — you don’t want the crust getting too brown on top as the eggs cook! If necessary, cover the outside ring of the crust with a bit of foil to prevent it from browning further.
        If you aren’t a fan of the traditional pie crust, try making a Puff Pastry Quiche or these Easy Mini Quiche made with wonton wrappers!</h4>
    <h4 class="para">How Do You Make a Crustless Quiche:
        If you’re looking for a gluten-free alternative, or you’re just not a big fan of crust (hey, we all have our own preferences!), you can absolutely skip the crust and just pour the egg mixture right into the pan to make this into a crustless quiche recipe. It’s that easy!
        
        Just don’t forget to grease the pie plate first because eggs can be tough to get out after they’re cooked!
        
        Since you won’t need to watch the crust for signs of doneness, you will just bake a crustless quiche until the eggs are completely set all through the center.</h4>
