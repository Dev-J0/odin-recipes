    <h4>What to do when your 8-year old nephew comes to visit? Make pizza, of course!

        Well, not of course, actually. I didn't think of it until we exhausted Sorry, Monopoly, and gin rummy. But it did turn out to be a brilliant idea as my father had just received a baking stone for Christmas, and my nephew loves pizza.
        
        I told him if he helped me make it I would talk about him on my website and he would be famous. That seemed to get his attention. He thought the dough was "slimy and gross" but he loved picking his own toppings, and the finished product was "awesome".</h4>
    <h4>The Best Flour for Homemade Pizza Dough
        Bread flour is the best flour for homemade pizza dough. You can use all-purpose flour instead of the bread flour called for in the recipe, but bread flour is higher in gluten than all-purpose flour and will make a crispier crust for your pizza.
        
        How To Make Sure Your Yeast Is Active
        Pizza dough is a yeasted dough that requires active dry yeast. Make sure the check the expiration date on the yeast package! Yeast that is too old may be dead and won't work.
        
        Also, if the yeast does not begin to foam or bloom within 10 minutes of being added to the water in Step 1 of Making the Pizza Dough, it is probably dead. You'll need to start over with new, active yeast.
        
        How To Measure Flour for This Pizza Dough Recipe
        Cup measurements can vary depending on how you are scooping the flour (we fluff the flour, lightly scoop it, and level with a knife). So I recommend using a kitchen scale to measure out the flour amounts by weight. This is the only way you'll get a consistently accurate measurement.</h4>

        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Making the Pizza Dough
                Proof the yeast:
                Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.
                
                After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved completely. The yeast should begin to foam or bloom, indicating that the yeast is still active and alive.
                
                (Note that if you are using "instant yeast" instead of "active yeast", no proofing is required. Just add to the flour in the next step.)</li>
            <li>
                Make and knead the pizza dough:
Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.

Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes.

If you don't have a mixer, you can mix the ingredients together and knead them by hand.

The dough should be a little sticky, or tacky to the touch. If it's too wet, sprinkle in a little more flour.
            </li>
            <li>Let the dough rise:
                Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil.
                
                At this point you can choose how long you want the dough to ferment and rise. A slow fermentation (24 hours in the fridge) will result in more complex flavors in the dough. A quick fermentation (1 1/2 hours in a warm place) will allow the dough to rise sufficiently to work with.
                
                Cover the dough with plastic wrap.
                
                For a quick rise, place the dough in a warm place (75°F to 85°F) for 1 1/2 hours.
                
                For a medium rise, place the dough in a regular room temperature place (your kitchen counter will do fine) for 8 hours. For a longer rise, chill the dough in the refrigerator for 24 hours (no more than 48 hours).
                
                The longer the rise (to a point) the better the flavor the crust will have.</li>
            <li>Preheat the pizza stone (or pizza pan or baking sheet):
                Place a pizza stone on a rack in the lower third of your oven. Preheat the oven to 475°F for at least 30 minutes, preferably an hour. If you don't have a pizza stone, you can use a pizza pan or a thick baking sheet; you need something that will not warp at high temperatures.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into two balls:
                Remove the plastic cover from the dough. Dust your hands with flour and push the dough down so it deflates a bit. Divide the dough in half.
                
                Form two round balls of dough. Place each in its own bowl, cover with plastic and let sit for 15 minutes (or up to 2 hours).</li>
            <li>Prep the toppings:
                Prepare your desired toppings. Note that you are not going to want to load up each pizza with a lot of toppings as the crust will end up not crisp that way.
                
                About a third a cup each of tomato sauce and cheese would be sufficient for one pizza. One to two mushrooms thinly sliced will cover a pizza.</li>
            <li>Flatten the dough ball, and stretch out into a round:
                Working one ball of dough at a time, take one ball of dough and flatten it with your hands on a lightly floured work surface.
                
                Starting at the center and working outwards, use your fingertips to press the dough to 1/2-inch thick. Turn and stretch the dough until it will not stretch further.
                
                Let the dough relax 5 minutes and then continue to stretch it until it reaches the desired diameter—10 to 12 inches.
                
                Treat the dough gently!
                
                You can also hold up the edges of the dough with your fingers, letting the dough hang and stretch, while working around the edges of the dough.
                
                If a hole appears in your dough, place the dough on a floured surface and push the dough back together to seal the hole.
                
                Use your palm to flatten the edge of the dough where it is thicker. Pinch the edges if you want to form a lip.</li>
            <li>Spread with tomato sauce and sprinkle with toppings:
                Spoon on the tomato sauce, sprinkle with cheese, and place your desired toppings on the pizza. Be careful not to overload the pizza with too many toppings, or your pizza will be soggy.</li>
            <li>Bake:
                Bake pizza in the 475°F oven, one at a time, until the crust is browned and the cheese is golden, about 10 to 15 minutes. If you want, toward the end of the cooking time you can sprinkle on a little more cheese.</li>
